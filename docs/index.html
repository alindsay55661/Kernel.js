                Kernel.js is an ultra lightweight (~4k) architecture for building scalable javascript applications.  It 
                provides a messaging system that allows you to build your apps in a decoupled and flexible fashion.  This
                project was inspired by <a href='http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=zakas-architecture'>
                Nicholas Zakas's talk on scalable Javascript architecture</a>.

                Addy Osmani used an excellent analogy</a> when talking about this architecture. He compared it to 
                airplanes and air traffic control. Airplanes don't interface with each other directly, they 
                talk with air traffic control to decide when they should land and take off. The Kernel hub is 
                like air traffic control and modules are like airplanes.

                Kernel.js is extremely easy to use right out of the box but it's meant to be extended and you'll get 
                a lot more utlity by doing so.  Writing your application takes only 3 steps.  If you haven't
                <a href="http://github.com/alindsay55661/Kernel.js">downloaded</a> Kernel.js yet be sure to do that before

            <h2>What isn't Kernel.js?</h2>
            <p>
                Kernel.js isn't a framework or base library like YUI or Dojo.  It's an architectural foundation that should
                be used in conjuction with those frameworks.  Kernel.js doesn't provide any low level utilities like
                underscore.js, doesn't provide any DOM manipulation like jQuery, and doesn't provide any widgets like ExtJS.
                While Kernel.js's utility is enormous, it stops at the architectural level.  To build a complex web application
                you'll need Kernel.js AND other libraries (base library, widget library, etc.).
            </p>
            
            <a name='license' class='anchor'></a>
            <h2>What are the license terms?</h2>
            <p>
                Kernel.js is open source software licensed under the popular MIT license.
            </p>
                        
            <a name='data-storage' class='anchor'></a>
            <h2>Where should I store my data?</h2>
            <p>
                That depends on your application.  In some cases it makes sense to store data on the hub.  For example,
                if you have a stream of information coming into your application (like stock quotes) you may consider
                storing that stream with the hub and then providing an api to access it or have the hub send notifications
                on its own.  This works well for things like dashboards or graphs that pull from a common data source.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                However, if your modules do not share data liberally it may make sense to store data on the modules.
                For example, you might have a module that takes data from the hub's stock ticker stream and does some
                number crunching on it.  We'll assume that number crunching is only relevant for that module.  In that case
                you'd store the crunched data with the module itself.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Another practice I use is to create service modules that manage various datasets. These modules are
                responsible for making data available to the hub so that other modules can access it.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As you can see, the data can live in more than one place.  This is largely a design decision that should
                be based on the needs of your application.
            </p>
            
            <a name='multi-hub' class='anchor'></a>
            <h2>Can I use multiple hubs?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes.  Right now the hub implementation allows you to setup as many hubs as you want.  Each module
                can only be attached to one hub and will only have access to the api of that hub.  However, currently
                all modules can listen to messages from any hub.  
            </p>
            <p>
                This feature was initially put in place to support api versions (so you can run older modules in newer apps)
                but I am open expanding this.  I've toyed with the idea of allowing a hub config that lets you restrict
                message routing to modules attached to that hub only.  Let me know how you think it should evolve.
            </p>

            <p>
                Good question!  I'd like to see more as well.  I currently use Kernel.js on commercial projects which
                are unavailable to the public.  If you have a project using Kernel.js that you'd like to share please
